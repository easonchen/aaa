#pragma mark - Login and logout
// Steps for authenticating a user with Box:
//      0. Go to your app settings on the Box developer site and make sure that your app has
//      a redirect URL field set to some custom url scheme, e.g. myappsboxlogin://auth_token_received
//      0.5. Go to your Info.plist and make sure that your app registers for being able to open
//      URLs with the custom url scheme you specified in your app settings on the developer site.
//      1. Call [Box initiateLoginUsingURLRedirectWithCallbacks:callbacks]. This will make an HTTP
//      request to the Box servers to get an authentication ticket. Upon receipt of the ticket, the
//      SDK will pass the control to another app (most likely Safari), which will guide the user
//      through login, and depending on the kind of account they have, also SSO process. Please read the
//      method documentation for details on the callbacks you can implement to listen for progress
//      in the login setup process.
//      2. Inside your app delegate's application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation: implementation,
//      check the passed in URL for your custom URL scheme, and if it matches call
//      [Box initializeSessionWithRedirectURL:url callbacks:callbacks], where url is the URL
//      your app was asked to open. By the time on.userInfo and on.after of your callbacks get called,
//      the user will have been logged in.

// If there is already a user logged in, this method is a no-op. Passed-in callbacks will not be called.
// Otherwise, this begins the login process. Your callbacks' on.before will be called immediately before
// the authentication ticket retrieval is attempted. The callbacks' on.after will be called upon success
// or failure of the HTTP call that retrieves the authentication ticket. The response argument will be set
// accordingly. If the authentication ticket retrieval is a success, the user will be taken to another app
// (most likely) Safari for login credentials entry.
+ (void)initiateLoginUsingURLRedirectWithCallbacks:(BoxOperationCallbacksDefine)callbacks;

// If there is already a user logged in, this method is a no-op. Passed in callbacks will not be called in that case.
// Otherwise, this method initializes the authenticating user's session. You can expect your callbacks' on.before to be called
// immediately before initialization. on.after will be called upon success or failure of the operation. The response
// argument will be set accordingly.

// You can also use the Box web APIs detailed at http://developers.box.com to implement your own user login.
// If you choose to do that, please call initializeSessionWithAuthToken:callbacks: with the auth token you
// obtain during login to take advantage of the library after authentication.

// If there is already a user logged in, this method is a no-op. No callbacks will be called in that case.
// Otherwise, this method initializes the authenticating user's session. You can expect your callbacks' on.before to
// be called immediately before initialization. on.after will be called upon success or failure of the operation.

#pragma mark - Observing box objects

// Registering as an observer allows your controller class to be notified when changes to the box objects take place (typically due

// the state of objects, as by observing you will receive notifications when the object has changed, even if you did not initiate
// the update.

// Note - currently observers are retained, which means observing classes should not remove themselves as observers in their dealloc methods
// or they will never be released.
